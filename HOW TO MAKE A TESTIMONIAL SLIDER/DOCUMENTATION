## Overview
The **Testimonial Slider** is a simple web page that displays user testimonials in a rotating slider. It showcases user feedback along with their profile pictures in an attractive, responsive design. The testimonials change every five seconds, looping through multiple user reviews.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For structuring the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the page and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For controlling the testimonial slider's functionality (auto-sliding between testimonials).

## HTML Structure

The HTML code is structured as follows:

1. **DOCTYPE Declaration**:
    - Declares the document type as HTML5.
  
2. **HTML Tag**:
    - `lang="en"`: Specifies the language as English.
    - `dir="ltr"`: Sets the text direction from left to right.
  
3. **Head Section**:
    - Contains meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings.
    - Links to two external CSS files for styling: `style.css` and `general.css`.
  
4. **Body Section**:
    - Contains a `div` element with the class `container`, which houses:
        - An `img` element: For displaying the user’s profile picture.
        - A `p` element with the class `text`: For displaying the testimonial text.
        - An `h4` element with the class `name`: For showing the user’s name.
    - Includes a link to an external JavaScript file, `script.js`.

## CSS Styling

The CSS controls the visual appearance and layout of the testimonial slider.

1. **Container**:
    - A fixed width of 500px with a minimum height of 150px and a minimum width of 400px.
    - A linear gradient background and rounded corners.
    - Padding of 70px from the top and 20px from the other sides.
    - Centers the content with `text-align: center`.

2. **Image Styling**:
    - The profile picture (`img`) is circular, with a width and height of 100px.
    - Positioned absolutely to overlap the container by 50px.

3. **Text and Name**:
    - The text (`p.text`) and name (`h4.name`) have dynamic font sizes set by CSS variables (`--text-size`).

4. **Responsive Design**:
    - A media query adjusts the container’s margin for screens with a maximum width of 600px, ensuring the design adapts to smaller devices.

5. **Root CSS Variables**:
    - Custom properties (`--text-color`, `--background-color`, `--text-size`) are used for text color, background color, and font size.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript controls the dynamic behavior of the testimonial slider.

1. **Testimonials Array**:
    - An array of objects, where each object contains:
        - `photoUrl`: The URL to the user’s photo.
        - `text`: The testimonial message.
        - `userName`: The user’s name.

2. **DOM Elements**:
    - The script selects and stores references to the `img`, `text`, and `name` elements using `document.querySelector()`.

3. **Testimonial Update Function**:
    - `updateTestimonials()` is a function that updates the content of the `img`, `text`, and `name` elements with data from the `testimonials` array.
    - The function uses destructuring to retrieve the testimonial's photo, text, and name from the current array index.
    - It then updates the `src` of the image, the `innerText` of the text paragraph, and the name element accordingly.
  
4. **Looping Through Testimonials**:
    - After displaying a testimonial, the `currentIndex` is incremented.
    - When the index reaches the end of the array, it resets to 0, creating a loop.
  
5. **Automatic Sliding**:
    - The `setTimeout()` function is used to call `updateTestimonials()` every 5 seconds, ensuring the testimonials update automatically.
