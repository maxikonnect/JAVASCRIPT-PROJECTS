Tip Calculator
Project Overview

The Tip Calculator is a web application that calculates the total amount based on the user-provided bill amount and tip percentage. The interface features a clean, modern design with responsive behavior. The functionality is driven by JavaScript, allowing users to input values and immediately calculate the total.
Project Structure
HTML (index.html)

The HTML structure includes:

    A container displaying the input fields for the bill amount and tip percentage.
    A button for calculating the total.
    A section that displays the result (total amount).
    An image representing food, giving a nice visual touch to the design.

CSS (style.css & general.css)

CSS Features:

    Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for smaller screens using media queries.
    Container Styling: The main container has rounded corners and a background color that enhances readability.
    Typography: The font sizes are large and easy to read, with headers and labels clearly distinguished.
    Interactive Button: The button is styled with hover and click effects to enhance the user experience.

JavaScript (script.js)

Functionality Overview:

    When the user clicks the Calculate button, the script checks for empty fields.
    If inputs are provided, it calculates the total by adding the tip to the original amount.
    It also handles errors by displaying a message if any field is left blank.
    The result is displayed with two decimal precision to ensure accurate financial calculations.

Features

    User-friendly Input Fields: Simple and clear input fields for amount and tip percentage.
    Dynamic Total Calculation: The total is updated instantly upon clicking the button.
    Error Handling: If fields are left empty, a red warning message appears.
    Mobile Responsive: The layout adjusts automatically for smaller devices, making it accessible on phones and tablets.
