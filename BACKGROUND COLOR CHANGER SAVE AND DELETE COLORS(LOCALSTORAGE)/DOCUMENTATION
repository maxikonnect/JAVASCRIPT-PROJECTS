Project Overview:

This project is a Background Color Changer web application that allows users to randomly change the background color of the page, save their favorite colors, and clear the list of saved colors. The webpage is structured with HTML, styled using CSS, and interactivity is provided using JavaScript.
HTML Structure:

    Meta Information: The metadata includes character encoding and viewport settings to ensure proper rendering on various devices. The page's title appears in the browser's tab.

    Header and Navigation: The header contains a simple navigation bar, typically used to allow users to move between pages on a website. In this case, it has a link to the homepage.

    Main Content: The main section of the webpage includes the interactive elements:
        A button to trigger a background color change.
        A display area to show the current background color name.
        Additional buttons to save and clear the list of background colors.
        A section to show the list of saved colors.

    Footer: The footer is fixed at the bottom of the page and contains copyright information.

CSS Structure:

    Global Styling: Basic global styles are applied to reset margins and paddings for consistent layout across different browsers. The box-sizing is set globally to ensure padding and borders are included in element sizes, making the layout more predictable.

    CSS Variables: Variables are defined for text and background colors to maintain consistency throughout the design. These can be easily reused and modified when necessary.

    Navigation Styling: The navigation bar is styled to appear as a horizontal menu with background color and padding, ensuring a user-friendly and clean design. Links within the navigation bar are styled without underlines and have a specific font size.

    Main Content Layout: Flexbox is used to center the main content both vertically and horizontally, ensuring that it is properly aligned and spaced on the page. The buttons and text elements are given adequate padding and margins for clarity and ease of use.

    Button Design: The buttons are styled with rounded corners, bold text, and a cursor change to improve interactivity and visual appeal. Margins are added between buttons to ensure they don't overlap and are clearly separated.

    Footer Styling: The footer is styled to stay fixed at the bottom of the page, and its text is aligned to the right, with a color scheme matching the overall design of the website.

JavaScript Structure:

    Event Listeners: The project relies on event listeners to detect user interactions with the buttons. These listeners trigger different functions when users click on buttons to change the background color, save it, or clear the saved colors.

    Background Color Generation: A function is responsible for generating a random RGB color. When the user clicks the button, this random color is applied to the background of the webpage. The generated color is also displayed on the screen for the user to see the current color.

    LocalStorage Usage: To maintain the user's preferences across sessions, the background color and saved colors are stored in the browser's localStorage. This allows the webpage to remember the last selected background color, even after the page is refreshed or reopened.

    Save and Clear Functions:
        Save Function: When the user clicks the "Save Color" button, the current background color is added to a list of saved colors. This list is updated and displayed dynamically on the webpage.
        Clear Function: When the user clicks the "Clear Saved Colors" button, the entire list of saved colors is cleared from both the display and local storage.

    Displaying Saved Colors: The saved colors are dynamically rendered on the page, providing a visual list of previously saved background colors. Each saved color is displayed in a clear, easily readable format.
