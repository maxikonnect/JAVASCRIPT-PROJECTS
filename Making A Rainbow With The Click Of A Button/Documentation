## Project Overview
The **Rainbow Maker** project is a web page that allows users to display or hide a rainbow made from seven color div elements (representing the colors of a rainbow). When the user clicks a button labeled "Make a Rainbow," the divs either fill with the respective rainbow colors or become blank.

## Features
- **Interactive Button**: Users can click a button to toggle the rainbow colors on and off.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage adjusts its font size and layout for different screen sizes.
- **Styled Layout**: The page uses CSS for aesthetic enhancements like background gradients, button styling, and structured alignment.
- **Rainbow Colors**: The colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) are represented visually using separate div elements.

## HTML Structure
- The HTML document includes the following sections:
  - A **header** with a simple navigation menu.
  - A **main** section containing the project title, seven div elements representing the rainbow colors, and the interactive button.
  - External **CSS and JavaScript** files are linked for styling and functionality.

## CSS Styling
- **Global Styles**: General styles are applied to set default font sizes, margin, padding, and box-sizing for all elements. 
- **Rainbow Divs**: Each div element representing a rainbow color has a defined width and height. When activated, the divs are filled with their respective colors.
- **Button Styling**: The button is styled to have rounded edges, bold text, and a blue background. When hovered, the cursor changes to indicate it is clickable.
- **Media Queries**: The CSS uses media queries to adjust the font size on smaller screens for improved readability.

## JavaScript Functionality
- The JavaScript code is responsible for handling the interaction with the button.
- When the user clicks the button, the JavaScript function loops through each div element and checks if it already has a background color.
- If the div is blank, it fills the div with its respective color (based on its ID).
- If the div already has a color, the function removes the color, turning the div blank again.

---

## How It Works
1. **Initial State**: The page loads with the title, button, and empty divs (no colors).
2. **Button Click**: When the "Make a Rainbow" button is clicked, the JavaScript checks the current state of each div:
   - If the div is blank, it assigns a background color matching its ID.
   - If the div already has a background color, it removes the color.
3. **Result**: The user can toggle the rainbow colors on and off by repeatedly clicking the button.
