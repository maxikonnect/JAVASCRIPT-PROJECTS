### Project Overview: Background Color Changer

The **Background Color Changer** project is a simple, fun web application that lets users change the background color of the page at the click of a button. The color is generated randomly in RGB format, and the new color is displayed on the screen so you can see exactly what it is. The project is built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a great example of how these technologies work together to create interactive webpages.

#### HTML Structure
The main file, `index.html`, provides the structure for the page. Here’s a quick breakdown of what it includes:

- **Header:** This section contains a navigation bar with a link to the homepage.
- **Main Section:** 
  - A large heading (`<h1>`) that displays the title of the project, "Background Color Changer."
  - A paragraph (`<p>`) that updates dynamically to show the current background color.
  - A button (`<button>`) that, when clicked, triggers the color change.
- **Footer:** A footer at the bottom of the page displays the copyright notice.

The HTML file also links to two CSS files to style the page and a JavaScript file to handle the background color changes.

#### CSS Styling
The design of the page is handled by two CSS files: `general.css` and `style.css`.

- **general.css:** This file sets the foundation for the entire project.
  - It defines global CSS variables for things like text and background colors, making it easy to keep the design consistent.
  - It also resets the default margin and padding for the webpage to ensure the layout looks clean across all browsers.
  
- **style.css:** This file contains specific styling for different sections of the page.
  - **Header:** The navigation bar is styled to remove bullet points and include a background color, with links customized for a clean look.
  - **Main Section:** The main content is centered using `flexbox`, making sure everything looks balanced. The button is designed with padding, rounded corners, and bold text to make it stand out.
  - **Footer:** The footer is fixed at the bottom of the page with a background color, ensuring it stays in place even when the page content changes.

#### JavaScript Functionality
The magic of changing the background color happens in the `script.js` file. Here’s how it works:

- **Getting the Elements:**
  - The JavaScript code identifies the paragraph (`.colorName`) where the color name will be displayed and the button (`.changeColor`) that will trigger the color change.

- **Button Click Event:**
  - When the user clicks the button, an event listener activates the `changeMyColor` function.

- **changeMyColor Function:**
  - This function generates three random numbers between 0 and 255, which represent the red, green, and blue (RGB) values of a color.
  - The new color is then displayed as a string in RGB format (e.g., `rgb(255, 100, 200)`).
  - The paragraph is updated to show this new color, and the background of the page changes to the new color instantly.

#### Key Features of the Project
- **User Interaction:** Users can click the button to change the background color and see the new color displayed in RGB format.
- **CSS Variables:** Colors and fonts are controlled using CSS variables, making it easy to update the design later.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is centered and styled to look good on different screen sizes, with a fixed footer for a polished look.

#### Summary of Files
- **index.html:** Defines the structure of the webpage.
- **style.css:** Contains the main styling for the page.
- **general.css:** Provides general resets and global styles.
- **script.js:** Handles the logic for changing the background color.

This project is a simple and engaging example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can work together to create interactive web experiences.
